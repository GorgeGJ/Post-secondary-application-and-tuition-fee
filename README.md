# Post-secondary-application-and-tuition-fee

Under the market mechanism, it is obvious that price and quantity depend on each other. First, I am trying to find whether it is also true in the education market where the application number seems has no influence on university tuition, especially for top universities.

# Methodology

Similar to the demand and supply mechanism, I applied simultaneous equations to solve endogeneity, In the education market, the number of applications is quantity, and tuition is price. Applicants demand a college education, and colleges set the price (tuition fee). Hence, the demand side focuses on the number of applications, where the supply side is based on the tuition fee. The number of application and tuition fee are jointly determined, where they are in no way exogenous to each other. Therefore, we instinctively apply Simultaneous Equations Model (SEM).

# Data Source:

http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/index.html#college This website includes cross-sectional statistics of average graduates income from every university, which is an important instrumental variable. Also, it includes several university characteristics: graduation rate, enrollment, rejection rate etc..

https://data-planet.libguides.com/education This website provides statistics on the number of applications received, number of staff (faculty and administrative) and also tuition fee. The public dataset is from IPEDS(The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System). Delta.public is a handy IPEDS dataset firstly analyzed by DELTA COST PROJECT. The data is not first handed, but it is well formatted.
